This small set of utils allowing to use this:
ID 041e:3100 Creative Technology, Ltd [Philips Electronics - RCS Singapore Creative USB IR Receiver]
on Linux.


files in project:

README - this file
SConstruct - better than makefile
creative-ir.rules  - udev rules setting up permissions and symlinks
event_dispatcher.pl - perl scripts which parses the output of hid_read and launches events
hid_read.cc - program reading from /dev/usb/rm1500 and puting the keycodes on standard output


installation.

install  creative-ir.rules into udev 

on debian
# cp creative-ir.rules /etc/udev/
# ln -s ../creative-ir.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/z60_creative-ir.rules
# invoke-rc.d udev restart

now build
% scons
and run
% ./event_dispatcher.pl

perl script should now launch the hid_read, read the keycodes and remote-control mp3 player


dependecies:
for hid_read: c compiler, proper /usr/include/hiddev.h, scons for building (or you can compile it by hand)
for event_dispatcher.pl: Xmms perl modules


ps. if you don't like this project, write a better one ...
